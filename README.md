# Readme Generator  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
    
## Description

In order to ease the process of creating a README file for projects, and bypass needing to consistently reviedifferent sites for best practices, a site was created that would incorporate those best practices. This accellerates the process of creating readme files so the developer can focus on more important tasks.

## Usage 

There is no site, this is a terminal driven project. Upon issuing the node index.js command in the appropriate folder, the README generator prompts the user with a series of questions which lead the developer to creating the required README.
